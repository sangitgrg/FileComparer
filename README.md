# FileComparer

This program uses pandas and numpy to compare two big excel files and create output with highlight in each cell that are not matched.
gener_compare.py is the main script for comparing.
Ignore other files, they are under development.

# Limitation

1. Comaprison should be done by taking one unique key/column from excel as a base for comparison
2. Row and column count should match between new and old excel file
